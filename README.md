# Datapack Compiler

A compiler for Minecraft datapacks.

This compiler implements a custom syntax for mcfunction files, which is _mostly_
compatible with the vanilla syntax and basically just adds a bunch of syntax
sugar which compiles down to regular vanilla mcfunction files.

The aim of this project is to make it easier to author Minecraft datapacks
without requiring to learn a whole new language.
